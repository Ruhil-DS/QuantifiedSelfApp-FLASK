# Lyf Record
- In this project, I have built a WebApp which can be used as an event logger. 
- Users can login to their account, create different sorts of tracker, and log values for that particular event in that tracker.
- Each user gets the CRUD functionality for their trackers and events(logs)
      - CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- I have used the following major technologies:
      
      - Python
      - Flask
      - Flask-SQLAlchemy
      - matplotlib's pyplot
      - HTML/CSS/JS/Jinja2/Bootstrap
      - SQLite
